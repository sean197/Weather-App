# Weather-App

This is a weather app using vanilla javascript. 

The aim of this project was for a user to be able to search for the weather conditions of a particular loation of choice.

The project was made using the accuweather app to create an api key which displayed the key of the location the user types in, using the key we were able to obtain the weather conditons.

When the user types in a location the countntry of the location, weather conditions are displayed eg. (cloudy, rainy, snow etc.) and finally the temperature of the location in degree celcuis are all displayed.

This was my first fetch API app and thus was used to consolidate my knowldge.
